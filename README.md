# Palindrome Checker

1. Lines 27 - 28 first creates a function that reverses a word passed into it, from the last element to the first, taking the last element to be the first till the word.length = 0 using a FOR loop at line 30 and 31.
2. Each element is concatenated with string type variable declared as testString, it will concatenate in each iteration untill word.lenghth <= 0.
3. the reverse_string function will return the tsetSring with the reversed word.
4. The function reverse_Stringe is called at line to reverse the Read(word).
5. the IF condition in line 8 to 10 check if word contains a single character of an empty space, if yes then it will read the WOR IS Palindrome and END_IF, else it will move to the next if.
6. The next IF at line 13 compare the ending character in each word against the other if they are equal.
7. if the word.length and reverse_word.length are equal then the IF condition at line 15 compare the reversed string againts each other to check if the word is a palindrome.
8. if word = reverse_stringe then it will write "it is a palindrome" else it is not a palindrome.
